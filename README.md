### Assessment of Your Survey Form

Your survey form is well-structured and visually appealing. It effectively utilizes **HTML** and **CSS** to create a user-friendly interface. The **use of CSS variables** for colors and fonts improves maintainability. However, there are some areas for improvement:
- **Radio buttons issue**: The `name` attribute should be the same for all radio buttons in a group to allow only one selection.
- **Checkbox `name` duplication**: Multiple checkboxes share the same `name="improvement"`, which can cause issues in data collection.
- **Image path issues**: The `background-image` URLs should be verified to ensure they are correctly loaded.
- **Form responsiveness**: The form is responsive but could benefit from additional padding and better alignment on smaller screens.
- **Semantic improvements**: Instead of `<br>` tags, consider using CSS for spacing to improve code readability.

With these refinements, your form will be more functional and maintainable. Great job!
